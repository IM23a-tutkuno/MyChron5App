## Description
A Python App for Assetto Corsa that Simulates the GUI of the MyChron5. The Data is accessed over shared memory.
The app is pure python and entirely coded by me. I have been in the Assetto Community as a player for a long time and now I can
finally contribute to the mod scene even if its something small. I hope you enjoy!

Features:
- RPM indicator
- Speed indicator
- Gear indicator
- Lap indicator
- Current Laptime
- Best Laptime
- Pedal in %<br>
<br>
WATER/EXHAUST TEMP AND LAMBDA ARE FIXED VALUES AND DONT REPRESENT THE CARS/KARTS ACTUAL STATE<br>

## INSTALLATION
1. Copy the MyChron5App folder into assettocorsa\apps\python
2. Copy EuroStyle Normal.ttf into: assettocorsa\content\fonts
3. Activate the app in ContentManager (Settings/Assetto Corsa/Python Apps)
4. Enjoy!
